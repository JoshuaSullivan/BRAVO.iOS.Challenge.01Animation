Quick Challenge: Animating Counting Text
========================================

This is the first challenge of a new series of activities. The goal of this series of challenges is to give developers a chance to explore portions of the API that have a discrete, small scope and that are likely to be less understood.

The minimum requirements for the challenge are as follows:

1. The app must have a label at the top of the view and one button at the bottom labeled "Run".
2. When a users presses the start button, the app will start by displaying the number 900 and animate by counting whole numbers up to 1050. This animation should take 2 seconds to complete. There is a video file with a sample of the animation included in the git repo.

Additionally, the best solutions will include these features:

1. The duration should be able to decrease to .5 second or increase to 3 seconds by entering a value or changing a single constant value.
2. The start and end values should be able to be change easily by entering a value or changing a single constant value.
3. The animation should be able to slow down it's animation speed so that it eases into the target number.
4. The solution should be extendable to other animating other properties.

I'm making a contest of the challenge. Entries will be accepted up until 10/25/2013. All entries will be evaluated by Ben Dolmar and the best challenge will be announced at the next iOS Talk Shop and win a free lunch. In addition, I'll post my solution to the problem on that Friday and include an article explaining how I approached the problem.

To submit an entry for evaluation, please do the following:

1. Fork the project from [https://github.com/bdolmar/BRAVO.iOS.Challenge.01Animation](https://github.com/bdolmar/BRAVO.iOS.Challenge.01Animation).
2. Post your files to your public fork on Github. 
3. Send a pull request back to the original repository with your project by midnight on 10/25/2013.
